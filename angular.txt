Angular - front End Development Framework

            basic Command
        1. create project - ng new projectname
        2. run project - ng serve
        3. generate components: ng g c componentname
        4. angular services - ng g s service_folder/service_name
        5. Angular pipe - ng g p pipe-folder/pipe-name
        

            Basic building block

         1. Module - used to import 3rd party library
         2. components - to create html page (html, css, typescript file automatically download)
         3. selector - it will replace the html page for that component
         4. angular services - reusable code that can share between components  
                                if more than one component is using the same data the service can be used.
         5. asynchronus function -RxJs                              
         6. observable - is similar to promise in javascript
               subscribe(call back function) response came here
        7.  to get http method 
        8.  Dependency Injection - for sharing data between two dependent class 
                                   perform inside constructor  
                    syntax : access specifier variable name: class-name
        9. Data Binding - data sharing inside components (between html and ts)          
            - One Way Binding
                 -component(ts file) to view(html file)
                    - String Interpolation - {{variable name}}
                    - property Binding - [attribute] ="property-name"
                - view(html) to component(ts)  
                        -event binding - (eventname)="function-name ()"
                        -event binding using $event argument - (event-name) = "function-name($event)"

            - Two way binding 
                 -ngModel :
                     -import FormsModule  in appModule
                     - [(ngModel)]="property-name"         
        10. Directives - DOM manipulate
                - Component Directives
                - structural Directives -to add or remove html elements based 0n a condition or length of a array
                        - *ngIf = "condition"
                        - *ngFor = "let variale-name of array-name"(based on array length)
        11. Pipe  - transform user input  toanother formate
